# Exploring Type Classes

In this informal, hands-on talk, we will talk explore what type classes are, what they are used for,
and how to implement them in Scala. We'll discuss the advantages of using type classes over the OO
alternative of subtype polymorphism. And we'll experiment with the Scala simulacrum library, which
removes the boilerplate from Scala type classes, and provides a standard implementation pattern.
